# Node CORS Proxy
A nodejs reverse proxy with file based request caching, and options to add CORS header to the proxied request.

> Only run this in trusted non-public environments. As there are no restrictions on where requests are proxied from, or when the CORS header is enabled, it is open to XSS attacks.
